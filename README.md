## **Using Buoy**  

If you're coming from **HLS**, there is a tool for **importing your old mods and settings** to this version.  

1. Download the **BuoyImporter.exe** from the [latest release](https://github.com/FerretPaws/Buoy/releases) tab.  
2. Run it **before launching Buoy for the first time**—your data will be transferred.  
3. You can delete the **BuoyImporter.exe** after the process is complete.  

**To install Buoy:**  
- Download the [latest release ZIP](https://github.com/FerretPaws/Buoy/releases), extract the .zip to anywhere you like, then run the .exe inside there. Simple as that! Just remember to keep it inside the folder it extracts from!
- You’ll need to go through a one-time setup process.  

⚠️ **Do NOT download the source code** unless you know what you’re doing.  

## **USING HLSR ON LINUX OR STEAM DECK**
- Follow the guide **[here](https://github.com/FerretPaws/Buoy/blob/main/repores/LinuxGuide.md)**

## **Troubleshooting / Tips**  

- ❗ If you encounter any issues, try running the program as **administrator**.  
- ⚙️ You may need to install **[.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)** manually. While the installer attempts to automate this, it's not perfect.
- ⚙️ If the game runs without mods when you chose the modded run option, run WEBFISHING through Steam first and then go back to HLS:R and relaunch through there. (This is an uncommon issue)
